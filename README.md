A blind search solution to amazon product delivery sample problem 

Problem: 
An online retailer wants to create a delivery system in which packages are 
own from the warehouse
directly to each customer's front door. Their first idea (autonomous drones) was unreliable, so the
company switched from robotic technology to a fleet of highly-trained Amazon Parrots. But while
the birds are able to deliver packages safely, they can't read the address labels, which means they
regularly deliver items to the wrong address. For instance, on the first day of testing, five packages
were supposed to be delivered to five separate customers, each of whom lived on a separate street. But
none of the customers got the correct order! The customer who ordered the Candelabrum received the
Banister, while the customer who ordered the Banister received the package that Irene had ordered.
Frank received a Doorknob. George's package went to Kirkwood Street. The delivery that should
have gone to Kirkwood Street was sent to Lake Avenue. Heather received the package that was to go
to Orange Drive. Jerry received Heather's order. The Elephant arrived in North Avenue; the person
who had ordered it received the package that should have gone to Maxwell Street. The customer on
Maxwell Street received the Amplifier. Who ordered each package, and where did each person live?
